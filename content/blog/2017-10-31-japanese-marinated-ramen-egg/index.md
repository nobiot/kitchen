recipe:
  servings: 2 eggs
  prep: 10 minutes
  cook: 6 minutes (then leave in fridge overnight)
  
  ingredients: |
    * 2 large eggs 
    * 2 tbsp soy sauce
    * 2 tbsp mirin
    * 6 tbsp water
    
  instructions: |
    1. Put soy sauce, mirin and water in a plastic bag. Set aside.
    2. Soft boil the eggs. Boil water in a saucepan, gently put eggs in the boiling water, and then reduce the heat to simmer. I like 6 minutes; the original recipe suggests 7 minutes -- this is to your taste
    3. Take out the eggs from the saucepan. Let them cool in cold water in a bowl. About 3 minutes.
    4. Gently peel the eggs.
    5. Put the eggs in the sauce bag we set aside. Seal the bag, and then leave in the fridge overnight. The original recipe suggests minimum 3-4 hours; recommends overnight. 
    6. Be excited like it's Christmas today; Santa is in town! Take out the eggs from the bag, cut them in half. Rejoice!

## Notes ##

I adapted this recipe from the original in [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/ramen-egg/). It is arguably the easiest ramen egg recipe you can find in English on the internet, with minimum ingredients reqiured and tastes awesome.

The original recipe says 7 miniutes to boil the egg. I did 6 minutes. I did not use the ice and water -- I just put the boild eggs in cold tap water. I got consistency I like. Perfect :)
