    3. Add the garlic and ginger. After nice aroma comes out, add the rest of ingredients
    4. Wait until the mixture to boil. Stop the heat. Put a lid on and leave for one hour. That’s it!!

## Notes ##
If you don’t have a lid for your pan (I didn’t), then you can use a sheet of aluminum foil as a lid. If your pan is shallow, turn the meat from time to time.

This recipe is originally from [cookpad](https://cookpad.com/recipe/1145363){:target=“_blank”}. A good friend of mine in Melbourne, Kanako, found the recipe for a home dinner party we organised. It was a huge success with a minimal effort on our part. Since then I cooked this with other friends twice; very easy and reliable.
