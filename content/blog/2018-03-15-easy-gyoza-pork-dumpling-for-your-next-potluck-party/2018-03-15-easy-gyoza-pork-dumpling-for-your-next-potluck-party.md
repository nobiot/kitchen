recipe:
  ingredients: |
    * 50 Gyoza skin [^1]
    * 200-300g Minced pork
    * 1 Spring onion
    * 1 Lettuce (small, or 1/2)
    * 1 piece (3cm) Ginger (or tube)
    * 3 cloves Garlic
    * 1 teaspoon Mirin
    * 1 tablespoon Soy sauce
    * 1 tablespoon Sesame oil
    * Salt & pepper
    [^1]: For this occasion, I used Japanese skins I got from the Japanese grocery shop in Paris, Kiyoko. There are Chinese-style skins available. I prefer Japanese style because they are thinner. It's a matter of taste, of course.

  instructions: | 
    1. Finely slice lettuce. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Leave for 30 minutes
    2. Finely slice garlic and spring onion. Grate ginger; squeeze to get the juice [^2]
    3. Mix everything but the skin: lettuce, pork mince,  garlic, spring onion, ginger, salt, pepper, sesame oil, soy sauce, and mirin
    4. Wrap the mixture with skins [^3]
    5. Lay oil on frying pan. Once hot, lay the gyozas. Brown the bottom. Pour some water and put the lid on to steam cook the gyozas. Wait until the water is all evaporated, or the gyozas are nicely brown

    [^2]: I discard what's left of the juice but possibly usable. Alternatively, the original instruction says you can use a tube paste; I have never had one. 

    [^3]: There are different ways for different families. I might do another post... I am still learning. A useful tip is, do not put too much mixture on the skin.
