    * 1/2 cup dried apricots
    * 1/4 cup raw cashews
    * 3/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut

    5. Firmly press the apricot mixture into the baking pan, using the flat surface of a measuring cup to create a flat even layer.

## Notes ##

This recipe is originally from [NITK (Nutrition in the Kitchen)](http://www.nutritionistinthekitch.com/apricot-cashew-energy-bars/). 
This is super easy and does not need baking. I used these bars for my full marathon running events as well as in-door bouldering / top-rope climbing sessions. They work really well :)

From my experience, the recipe is really forgiving; you don't really have to be very precise. I screwed up many elements (see below), but in the end the energy bar still came out nicely. 

* I didn't have agave syrup, so used honey instead
* And... I forgot to put in oats (!). But in the end, the energy bar came up really nice
* Didn't have hemp seeds, so used poppy seeds instead
* The size of the tray I had then only allowed half the size of the original recipe -- no problem

My ingredients all came from my local supermarket (at the time I took the photos, I was in London; Sainsbury's near Southwell or Clapham North).

You do need some time to leave the stuff in the freezer (1 hour), so for a marathon, walking, hiking, picnic, etc., make the bars beforehand when you have time (the recipe says they will last 1 month in the fridge)
