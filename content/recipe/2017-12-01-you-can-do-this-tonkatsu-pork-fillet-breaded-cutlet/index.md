recipe:
  servings: 2-3
  prep: 10-20 minutes
  cook: 10-20 minutes
  
  ingredients:  |
    * 150-250 grams pork fillet
    * Some panko breadcrumbs (enough to coat the pork. I used German one)
    * 1 egg (I didn’t know how to have only half of an egg, so I used 1 egg...)
    * 1-1.5 tbsp flour
    * salad oil for 2-3cm in the saucepan to be used for frying
    
  instructions:  |
    1. Cut port fillet. Cut into pork and make grooves (10 or so).
    2. Salt both sides. Black pepper on one side only.
    3. Coat pork with flour. Remove excess.
    4. Whisk egg well. Coat pork. Remove excess.
    5. Coat pork with panko breadcrumbs. 
    6. Heat up the oil in the saucepan to 180°C. This will go down to around 170°C when you put the pork in. Try to keep 165-170°C over medium heat.

## Notes ##
This is great as it is. Or will be a component for katsudon (recipe to come :)).

I adapted this recipe: [思いっきりかつ丼 (Katsudon)](https://www.1101.com/life_iijima/pdf/30_katsudon.pdf).
