“And if all behavior is prompted by a desire to escape discomfort, that means time management is pain management”

If cooking a meal is what we intend to do, and we get distracted away from it... Like not feeling like cooking for some reason.
Easy a home-cooked meal is a delayed satisfaction. It will save us from pain “at a later point” — pleasure of eating healthy; nutrition to our body, instead of empty calories. 

Cooking out of a sense of duty — for yourself, for your family, for your loved ones — may not be a sustainable source of motivation to cook meals. 

“If there's one motto I want people to remember it’s: the antidote to impulsiveness is forethought”.
